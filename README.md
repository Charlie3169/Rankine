# Rankine
---
## Introduction
What is your 32nd favorite Shakespearean play? Does your friend generally prefer halogens or noble gases? What percentage of the population's favorite temperature system is Rankine?  

Rankine provides the tools for you to:  
- Create sets of books, numbers, or anything else you might want to rank, or download sets that other people have created  
- Decide your favorite (and least favorite) things through a one-on-one matchmaking system  
- Analyze your rankings based on custom categories such as genre, relative size, or designer  
- Share and compare your rankings with friends, family, and the general public  

Make your rankings and save them to the cloud or export your favorite results to PDF to send to your friends over email. Attach images to your objects for a more visually distinct experience, and schedule reminders to continue rankings that are too large to finish in one sitting.
